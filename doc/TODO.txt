* change generate_tagfile tests to use tmpfiles
* scalability, very large projects (i.e. kernel source) take a long long while and should possibly give some feedback
* add write() method to ctags_file, so the user can save it if they decide to
* extend custom parameter tests for generation, particularly for situations where args are used internally
* provide information on files that ctags didn't process but were in file list
* add "queries" to tagfile for extended tag values, so you could list all methods, or all functions, or all Python, whatever
* generate and store at runtime tags per-file, so that ctags doesn't have to be run on every file whenever one is changed
* add a sort of max info option to exuberant ctags wrapper, to make a shortcut for generating the most information on source
* command line parameters for exuberant ctags may depend on exuberant ctags version, particularly --langmap and --flags, so make that easy
