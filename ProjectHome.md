Pyctags is a Python language wrapper for ctags programs and a parser for output generated by ctags.  It can be used for harvesting information from tags files or generating new tags files.  With the language feature extensions available to [Exuberant Ctags](http://ctags.sourceforge.net/index.html), this module can be useful for static code analysis and discovery for dozens of programming languages.

Pyctags 0.5.0 has been tested on Python 2.5 and 3.0 on Windows and Linux, with Exuberant Ctags 5.7 and Subversion [revision 686](https://code.google.com/p/pyctags/source/detail?r=686).

The [Wingware Python IDE](http://www.wingware.com/) was a great tool to use, especially the excellent debugger.
